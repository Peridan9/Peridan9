## üöÄ Projects

### **Physics-Informed Machine Learning in Aircraft Simulation**
- Repository: [PINN Module for Aircraft Simulator](https://github.com/Peridan9/PINN-module-for-aircraft-simulator)
- Description: Developed a proof of concept showcasing how integrating physical laws into the loss function of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can improve accuracy in simulating aircraft movement.
- Implemented LSTM models to capture temporal dependencies in flight data.
- While the project demonstrated potential, it remains a foundational step and is not a complete solution.


### **Full-Stack Recipe Finder** (Ongoing)
- A web app for searching and saving recipes based on user preferences.
- Exploring Docker and cloud technologies for deployment.
